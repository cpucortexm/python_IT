# Unit tests Script to run on an old script to find out any errors seen in the old script and rectify the same


## Steps
1. Run the original old script (emails.py) with the necessary params
2. Run the original script with edge cases and see if they pass
3. If there are errors seen, then introduce a new unit tests file (emails_test.py) and write all the edge case unit tests.
4. Make corrections in the original old script needed to pass the edge cases
5. Finally run all the unit tests with the edge cases and it should now pass all the tests
